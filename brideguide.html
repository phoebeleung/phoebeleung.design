  <h4>Defining the problem</h4>
  <p>Planning a wedding is no small feat. Decisions have to be made, images are shared, and opinions must be gathered from different social circles. BrideGuide is an upcoming iOS app that will serve as a collaboration tool for brides managing their weddings, bachelorette parties, and bridal showers. While there are plenty of existing wedding planning tools out there, BrideGuide aims to be the most collaborative, seamless, and social, with features for chat, task assignments, and surveying.</p>
<p><b>Our team worked with the founders of BrideGuide to create the visual design for the iOS app and delivered style tiles, screen mock-ups, prototypes, and a style guide.</b></p>

<h4>Existing designs</h4>
<p>The existing brand material we were given already had an already existing color palette, which were varying shades of a muted/pale pink.</p>

<h4>Design goals</h4>

<p>Our team identified the key challenge as we moved into designing BrideGuide over the next three weeks: <b>How do we design BrideGuide to be as feminine, fun, and personal as the experience of planning a wedding should be, while ensuring that the app still comes across as professional and sophisticated?</b></p>

<p>We conducted a visual competitive analysis and found that all wedding apps on the market lacked the fundamental strong visual hierarchy that most successful productivity apps had.

With deeper understanding where BrideGuide could fit in within the market of wedding planning and productivity apps, our team created three design principles to guide our designs moving forward.</p>

<p><b>1) It’s your big day</b><br>
The design of BrideGuide will be versatile by allowing the bride to connect to the planning process and make the experience her own.</p>

<p><b>2) Let us do the heavy lifting</b><br>
Keep the bridal party involved and accountable without tension. Content should be scannable, which makes it easier for them to stay up to date and help when needed.</p>

<p><b>Spread the love</b><br>
Connecting with one another should be an enjoyable and fun experience. There is a camaraderie that forms when participating in such a celebratory occasion. Design elements should promote a friendly tone and feeling.</p>

<h4>Design direction</h4>
<p>With the design principles and competitive research findings in mind, I created style tiles for client review. After reviewing several different directions with the client, we converged into the following style direction:</p>

<p>Although the clients were surprised at the change in color palette, they did begin to warm up to the idea of introducing more colors and using pink more sparingly to achieve the same goals of femininity and modernity.</p>

<h4>Iterations and testing</h4>
<p>Using our research and clients’ direction, I created my first round of screen mock-ups. I used a marble texture and clean white space to create sophistication. Pink was only used in key CTA areas, and strong visual hierarchy in headers helped users easily scan content-heavy lists. Our user pool consisted of a mix of bride-to-be’s and bridal party members, providing us with a good mix of user feedback.</p>

<p>During user testing many users described my design was clean, modern, and feminine. Many users also commented that the app definitely felt geared towards female, even though there was a minimal use of pink – this was a piece of user feedback that helped further our team’s case with the client on utilizing a different color palette for BrideGuide.</p>

<p>The main critique for my designs from users was all elements on the page looked as if they were <b>floating due to an awkward use of white space</b>. As I moved forward into my final iterations of the design, I continued to user test different solutions to anchor the elements on my design.</p>

<h4>Final designs</h4>
<p><p><img src="assets/BGfinal0.png" width="220px"> <img src="assets/BGfinal1.png" width="220px"></p>
<p>To resolve the issue of “floating” elements on the page, items on the dashboard page utilize white space more efficiently and are anchored with the use of status boxes. A status of pink denotes that a task is completed. The drop shadow is used to draw attention to the name of the couple and countdown, to add an emphasis on personalization.</p>
