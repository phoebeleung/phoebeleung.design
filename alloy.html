<h3>Alloy<br>Role: Product Designer<br>Time: 1 year</h3>

<section class="casebody">

  <p>I redesigned the global internal search tool for a consulting firm. I worked across the entire design process from UX research and wireframing concepts to design language creation, high fidelity mock-ups, and front-end engineering hand-off documentation. I balanced user needs with stakeholder demands as we ready the product for MVP launch.</p>

  <p>The biggest challenge of this project was balancing a modern design with an incredibly complex information architecture. I conducted user interviews on a regular basis to get a feel for how consultants are currently using the tool, to ensure that in modernizing the design, there would be little to no functionality lost.</p>

  <p>Much of my work at Alloy is confidential, so please reach out if you'd like to see more for hiring purposes.</p>
