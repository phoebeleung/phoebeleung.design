  <h3>ðŸ‘‹ 137 words about myself</h3>

    <p>Iâ€™ve lived in New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai, San Francisco, and Los Angeles and have always been fascinated by the connections between people and their surroundings.</p>

    <p>That interest led me to pursue a psychology degree and learn more about human perception. I then spent years in advertising, where I helped brands such as Anheuser Busch In-Bev, Synchrony Financial, FINRA, and Apple effectively reach their target audiences.</p>

  <p>Today, Iâ€™m based in NYC as a product designer at Stack Overflow. I think of myself as a design generalist as I enjoy the holistic process of design: strategy, UX, and visual design. I'm working on my front-end skill set (I coded this portfolio!).</p>

  <p>When Iâ€™m not designing, I can be found exploring new music, running or traveling.</p>
